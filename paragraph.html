        <h1> ABOUT GIT:</h1>
        <h4>
            
        <br>Git is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. 
        <br>Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally.
        <br>This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.
        <br>Git also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools.
        <br>Pull requests are one such popular tool that allows teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each other's code.
        <br>Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development.
